Welcome to my GitHub repository for an EV population dashboard report made using CSV and Power Bi using data visualization. This repository contains the dataset (in xlsx or csv format), the dashboard (in pbix), and the dashboard converted into pdf format. The report provides insights into the EV population in a specific region/country. It includes visualizations that show the number of EVs in the region/country, the type of EVs, and their distribution across different cities. The report also includes visualizations that show the growth of EVs over time and their impact on the environment. The report is created using Power Bi, which allows for interactive data exploration and analysis. Feel free to download the dataset and use it for your own analysis.
